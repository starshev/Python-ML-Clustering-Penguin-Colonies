# Clustering with Python Â· Penguin Colonies
  
**Context**
  
As a consultant for a scientific organization that works to support and sustain penguin colonies, I am tasked with helping other staff members learn more about penguins and confirm if penguins of the same species exhibit different physical characteristics based on sex, regardless their location. In particular, using the k-means clustering technique.
